Análise dos Cenários
Cenário Base
The base case scenario projects consistent monthly balances, leading to a steady increase in cumulative balance over the six-month period. This indicates a stable financial performance with no significant fluctuations in revenue or expenses. The business is expected to maintain its current trajectory, generating positive cash flow each month.

Com Alterações
The scenario with changes, reflecting a 5% increase in revenue and expenses, shows a slightly improved balance and cumulative balance compared to the base case. This suggests that the business can absorb moderate changes in revenue and expenses without significant negative impacts. The cumulative balance grows at a slightly faster rate, indicating enhanced profitability under these conditions.

Cenário Otimista
The optimistic scenario, with increased revenue and reduced expenses, demonstrates the most significant positive impact on cash flow. The monthly balances and cumulative balances are substantially higher than in the base and with changes scenarios. This highlights the potential for significant financial gains if the business can achieve higher revenue and lower costs, leading to a strong and rapid accumulation of cash.

Cenário Pessimista
The pessimistic scenario, with decreased revenue and increased expenses, reveals a negative impact on cash flow. While the business remains profitable, the monthly balances and cumulative balances are lower than in the base case. This underscores the importance of mitigating risks associated with revenue decline and cost increases to maintain financial stability. The business needs to closely monitor its performance and implement corrective actions if these conditions arise.

Impacto no Fluxo de Caixa
The analysis reveals that the business is currently in a stable financial position, with positive cash flow across all scenarios. The optimistic scenario highlights the potential for significant growth, while the pessimistic scenario underscores the importance of risk management. The average delay in receivables (5 days) and payables (1 day) should be monitored to ensure that the business has enough liquidity to meet its obligations.
